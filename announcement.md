Hey @everyone. As you may have already seen, malware was recently discovered in Project Retrac's anticheat. We have talked with their staff and have come to the conclusion that it was one of their developers that tried to sneak the malware in, coupled with poor security practices by the staff. This information has already somewhat been made public, however, we dislike how the Retrac staff have treated this situation.

For a deeper analysis, you can check out this GitHub repository: <https://github.com/Toxy121/Retrac-Analysis>

Firstly, I'd like to cover some misconceptions that you may seen, specifically the ones from Raax:
### 1. "The file grabber specifically targeted Snark and did not affect regular users."
This claim is purely based off of what the malicious developer said himself. There is no real proof to prove that this is indeed true. In the analysis, I show that the server decides whether the client side anticheat should steal any files and send them back to the server. We have already asked for Retrac to send the server to us for further analysis, but they have denied claiming they no longer have access to it.

### 2. "Retrac is now most likely safe to play."
This is up to you to decide, we will not be making suggestions regarding this topic. Just so you're aware, the owner of Retrac is the same person that put malware into FMod, subsequently causing the project to shut down. <https://youtu.be/zHSNBqQAB4o>

### 3. "Retrac's staff were completely unaware of this situation until very recently. As soon as they discovered the issue they reached out to Snark, Toxy and Boosted to resolve the issue."
This is not true. Many of Retrac staff were in the discord chat as the server was being nuked, with an announcement the next day suggesting Retrac was the cause. Despite Retrac staff seeing it, they decided to simply ignore it. They did not reach out to us and attempt to resolve the issue. We had to get into contact with them ourselves along with proof, in order for them to even acknowledge the issue.

## Who did this?
We don't fully know. Retrac staff claim only the malicious developer was involved. However, there is really no way to prove this. The only evidence we have is messages between the Retrac staff and the developer himself, in which he admits it was him and that he was alone, so take it with a grain of salt.

## What's wrong with what Retrac is doing?
Despite having a massive security incident occur, it seems as if Retrac is trying to simply ignore it, and attempt to cover it up in order to protect their reputation. This is unacceptable considering the fact that everyone who played within those 1-2 days could have had their files stolen. At the very least, they must disclose this entire situation to their own members, so that they are informed on what has happened.
